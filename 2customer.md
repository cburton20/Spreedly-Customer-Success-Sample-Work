## I would like to migrate my payment methods to Spreedly from a big gateway. Is there a way I can get up and running collecting payment methods in production on Spreedly first and then do the migration of my vaulted cards so there is no processing gap? [Absolutely! Spreedly offers a gradual self-managed migration option that you can use the third party tokens from your current external vault for your existing customers while adding new customer payment methods to Spreedly's platform. Additionally, as customers update their payment methods over time, you can transition them from having a third party token payment method to having a universal payment method stored in the Spreedly vault.
## How can I connect my current gateway test instance to test our Spreedly implementation? [ You should have received a getting started guide with your onboarding package. Working through the getting started guide creates a test gateway and a test payment method for your team. Creating a test gateway will allow you to test all possible payment flows and is the first step in testing. A test gateway will not let you transact with live data, so you need to create test payment methods to work with the gateway. (The same is true of the test receiver type). To create a test payment method, use the standard payment method collection process specifying a test credit card or bank account number instead of a real number. These will automatically be recognized as test payment methods by Spreedly and will be allowed to transact against the test gateway.
## What are credit card fingerprints? How do I query a payment method based on the fingerprint?[ Great question! Fingerprinting is the unique process that assigns a randomly generated identifier to cards that share the same number. This makes it easy to identify when multiple payment methods represent the same underlying card.  In regards to your question about fingerprinting query, unfortunately, at the moment there is no way to query for payment methods based on the fingerprint, so itâ€™s up to you to store the fingerprint values in your system to perform any necessary reconciliation or querying.
## If I plan on doing approximately 60K to 80K api calls per month, which of Spreedly's pricing plans would be the most economical for my company?[ The most economical plan for your company would be our Scaling Plan. The cost of our Scaling plan is $1,500/month plus .5 cents per API call. Based on 80,000 API calls per month, you would be looking at $1,900 per month total. The calculations I provided are based on estimating at the top end of your range. You can look to pay well under this amount if your API calls fall under the 80,000.
## It looks like you do not allow storing of the CVV value when vaulting payment methods. Why is that and is there a way to add that info to a payment method again without having to recollect it in its entirety? [The reason for not being able to store CVV value when vaulting payment methods is due the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) regulation against storing CVV values. Spreedly is only allowed to pass along the CVV to your gateway for the first authorize, purchase, or verify that you run against a card. Future transactions using that vaulted card do not include the CVV. However, you do have the option to turn off the CVV requirement within your gateway for recurring purchases.
