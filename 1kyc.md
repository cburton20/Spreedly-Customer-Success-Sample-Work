## Based on your understanding of Spreedly, what opportunity do you think the founders saw in the marketplace that led to our launch? 

[The market was in need of a payment solution that could transact in virtually any country, connect to hundereds of client API's, all while minimizing a companies PCI compliance scope.] 
## What’s the major difference between our value story to a platform vs. an individual merchant? 

[Businesses need to be able to execute transtions across multiple gateways. With Spreedly, clients can transact with many partners/gateways with a single integration. The single integration also allows our clients to transact across multiple countries.
## What is the major difference between using Spreedly to connect to a payment gateway vs using Spreedly’s PMD to connect with a third party API? 

[The major different between using Spreedly to connect to a payment gateway vs using Spreedly's PMD is the dreaded redirect payment page once you hit the "buy now" button. Making payments on a third party site can quickly eliminate any trust built within the time the customer spend on your site. With Spreedly's PMD, we can eliminate this problem. Once the client clicks the "buy now" button, the customer stays on the client site and gets an update that the payment was successful.]
## Based on our documentation, what are the major differences between using a transparent redirect, an iFrame and Spreedly Express? 

[iFrame allows the client to utlize a more customized approach to collecting customer data. This method has a very low amount of PCI scope. Spreedly Express offers the easist and fastest way to implement. Simply drop in your page and wire up a few javascript calls. Spreedly Express has a very low PCI scope. Transparent Redirect is still supported. However, with the introduction of PCI DSS v3.0, we no longer recommend this method due the lack of minimization of PCI compliance.
